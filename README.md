# PLEASE START FOLLOWING gbm-developers/gbm:
https://github.com/gbm-developers/gbm

With the intention of ceasing to be such a bottleneck by having everything filtered through me, I've started the gbm-developers organization on GitHub.

Please switch to that version of gbm.

Thanks for your continuing contributions. They're much appreciated.
